# better-meeting

**Talk to your meeting recordings.** better-meeting is a pure extractor: it pulls *everything* out of a video — timestamped speech transcript, text that appeared on screen, key screenshots — into one self-contained folder. Hand that folder to any LLM as context, and ask it anything about the meeting.

**There is no LLM inside the tool.** It never summarizes, never interprets. Extraction is local and deterministic; the understanding is done by whatever model *you* connect — an agent that picks the folder up and reads it as context.

Works for any kind of recording: a daily standup that's all talk, a technical demo full of screen changes, a workshop, a plain call.

## Native macOS recorder

The repository also contains a SwiftUI recorder for macOS 15 and newer. It
captures the main display, system audio, and microphone, transcribes locally,
and creates a meeting folder with the recording and `transcript.md`.

See [`macOS/README.md`](macOS/README.md) for build and usage instructions.

```bash
bm meeting.mp4
# -> runs/meeting/artifacts/  (transcript.md, timeline.md, screens/)
```

## What it extracts

The pipeline runs in cached stages — each writes into the video's working folder, and re-running skips finished stages (`--force` redoes them):

| # | Stage      | What happens                                                       |
|---|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | `audio`    | `ffmpeg` extracts a 16 kHz mono WAV                                 |
| 2 | `transcribe` | Whisper (mlx on macOS / faster-whisper elsewhere) with timecodes — one pass per candidate language, merged |
| 3 | `frames`   | sample thumbnails, keep only keyframes where the screen changed    |
| 4 | `ocr`      | macOS Vision / tesseract reads each keyframe, diffs new on-screen text |
| 5 | `bundle`   | assembles `artifacts/`: transcript, timeline, screenshots          |

If OCR finds no readable text (low-res recording, or `--ocr none`), screenshots are still selected — evenly across the moments the screen changed — so a multimodal model can read them itself.

### Multilingual meetings

Whisper's built-in auto-detect samples only the **first 30 seconds** — useless for meetings that mix languages (a Ukrainian standup with English terms and Russian asides is an everyday case). `bm` doesn't guess:

When no language is pinned, it transcribes the whole recording **once per language** in `--langs` (default `uk,ru,en`), then merges: the timeline is covered by the segments from whichever pass Whisper was most confident about (`avg_logprob`) at that point. This survives *any* language mixing — down to the language switching between neighboring sentences — because every stretch of audio was decoded in every candidate language and the best decode wins locally. Hallucinated segments (Whisper's classic silence artifacts) are filtered by the standard `no_speech`/`logprob` heuristic.

The cost is proportional: 3 languages = 3 transcription passes. Each pass is cached separately (`pass_uk.json`, …), so an interrupted run resumes without redoing finished passes. If you know the meeting's language, pin it — `--lang uk` — for a single pass. Adjust the candidate set with `--langs uk,en` etc.

In multilingual recordings every transcript line carries its language tag (`[uk]`, `[en]`, `[ru]`), and the header of `timeline.md` reports the language share.

## One folder per video

Every recording gets **its own working folder** — outputs never collide or overwrite each other.

By default the folder is `runs/<video-name>/`:

```
runs/
├── standup-2026-08-20/
│   ├── audio.wav
│   ├── transcript.json
│   ├── keyframes.json
│   ├── thumbs/ · frames/
│   └── artifacts/          <- the interface: hand this folder to your LLM
│       ├── transcript.md   — timestamped speech
│       ├── timeline.md     — speech + new on-screen text + silences, merged
│       └── screens/ · screens_index.md
└── onboarding-call/
    └── ...
```

- Change the root with `--out-root some/dir` (folders become `some/dir/<video-name>/`).
- Pin an exact folder with `--out path/to/dir` (overrides the per-video naming).

Because the folder name is derived from the video, re-running the **same** recording reuses its cache; a **different** recording lands in a **different** folder.

## Install

Requires **Python 3.12+** and **ffmpeg/ffprobe** on your `PATH`.

### As a global `bm` command (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/GivenFLY/better-meeting.git
bm meeting.mp4
```

On Linux/Windows add the faster-whisper extra:

```bash
uv tool install "better-meeting[faster] @ git+https://github.com/GivenFLY/better-meeting.git"
```

Update later with `uv tool upgrade better-meeting`, remove with `uv tool uninstall better-meeting`.

### From a clone (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GivenFLY/better-meeting.git
cd better-meeting

# with uv
uv sync
uv run bm meeting.mp4

# or with pip
pip install -e .
bm meeting.mp4
```

### System dependencies

- **ffmpeg / ffprobe** — required (audio extraction, frame sampling, duration).
- **macOS** — Whisper via `mlx-whisper` and OCR via the built-in Vision framework work out of the box.
- **Linux / Windows** — install the faster-whisper backend and tesseract:
  ```bash
  pip install -e ".[faster]"   # faster-whisper ASR backend
  # + tesseract-ocr from your package manager, then run with: --ocr tesseract
  ```

## Usage

```bash
bm extract RECORDING.mp4 [options]   # `bm RECORDING.mp4` is the same thing
```

| `--asr-model NAME`     | `large-v3-turbo` | Whisper model                                     |
| `--frame-interval SEC` | `2.0`          | thumbnail sampling interval                          |
| `--max-shots N`        | `30`           | how many screenshots to keep in `artifacts/`        |
| `--ocr vision\|tesseract\|none` | `vision` on macOS | OCR backend                            |
| `-O KEY=VALUE`         | —              | any Whisper option for transcription, repeatable (e.g. `-O initial_prompt="project terms"`) |

Run `bm --help` (or `bm extract --help`) for the full list.

### Examples

```bash
# Ukrainian meeting
bm standup.mov --lang uk

# low-res recording where OCR is hopeless — skip it, keep the screenshots
bm call-360p.mp4 --ocr none

# fix domain vocabulary with a glossary hint
bm demo.mkv -O initial_prompt="service names, staging, rollout"

# batch a directory — each file gets its own folder under runs/
for f in recordings/*.mp4; do bm "$f"; done

# custom output root, keep more screenshots
bm demo.mkv --out-root out --max-shots 50
```

## Point queries — tooling for agents

Besides the full pipeline, `bm` has point commands so an LLM agent can drill into a specific moment without re-running anything. All print their result to stdout (logs go to stderr):

```bash
# grab one frame at a timecode (prints the file path)
bm frame meeting.mp4 -t 12:40
# -> runs/meeting/frames_at/00-12-40.jpg

# OCR a frame at a timecode (prints the recognized text)
bm ocr meeting.mp4 -t 12:40

# OCR an existing image (e.g. a screenshot from artifacts/screens/)
bm ocr runs/meeting/artifacts/screens/007_00-14-10.jpg

# re-transcribe a time range in a specific language
bm transcript meeting.mp4 --from 10:00 --to 12:30 --lang en

# ...with any whisper option passed through, and JSON output
bm transcript meeting.mp4 --from 10:00 --to 12:30 --lang uk \
    -O temperature=0.2 -O initial_prompt="назви сервісів, реліз, стейджинг" --json
```

Timecodes accept `SS`, `MM:SS`, or `HH:MM:SS`. The typical agent loop: read `timeline.md`, spot a suspicious stretch, pull the exact frame with `bm frame`, or re-run just that stretch with `bm transcript` — a different language, a domain `initial_prompt` to fix mangled terms, whatever Whisper accepts via repeatable `-O key=value` (values parse as JSON).

`bm transcript` results are **cached by their full parameter set** (range + language + model + backend + options) under `runs/<name>/transcripts_at/` — repeating the same query returns instantly; `--force` recomputes.

It also **reuses the full pipeline's work**: if the video already went through `bm extract` with the same model, backend and `-O` options, the range is sliced straight out of the cached passes — a pinned `--lang` serves from that language's pass, no `--lang` serves from the merged transcript. No ASR runs at all. Different options or `--force` trigger a real re-run.

Frames land under `frames_at/`; use `-o out.jpg` to override.

## Talking to the video

`artifacts/` is the whole interface. Tell your agent — *"better-meeting is installed as `bm`; run `bm agents` and follow that guide to work with `<video>`"*. `bm agents` prints the full agent manual ([AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)): how to extract, what the artifacts mean, and the point commands for drilling into moments. Then just ask anything: "what did we decide about the release?", "what command did they run at 12:40?", "summarize each person's status".
